        <h3 class="hometitle">What I've Learned So Far</h3>
        <p class="objective">My technical skills are coming along. I've spent my career developing my ability to write and communicate with language, and those remain strong, but I've had a steep learning curve for all types of code. I know that once I start playing around with my own sites, though, it will go much faster. That's how I developed all my other technical skills, and despite my age, I'm still confident I can do it that way.</p>
